# There's conflicting info on what Monte Carlo actually is.
# From this https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/option-pricing-2/:
# Monte Carlo is a method of calculating option prices by taking random
# variables (unlike BS model that takes 5 give variables).
# The Monte Carlo option model is the application of Monte Carlo Methods.
# This pricing model uses random samples to calculate the price.
# This method is more favorable than other methods like Black-Scholes
# for calculating the value of options with multiple sources of uncertainty.
# From wikipedia: Since the underlying random process is the same,
# for enough price paths, the value of a european option here should be
# the same as under Blackâ€“Scholes.
# MC process:
# 1. Simulate many stock price trajectories
# 2. Average the stock price for each of the simulated paths.
# 3. Calculate the payoff (option premium) for each simulated price.
# 4. Average the payoffs for all paths.
